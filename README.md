# Overwatch Party

Run overwatch 6v6 customs with a large group of friends (12+) more easily.

Goals:
- Track who has/hasn't had a turn. Store previous games teams into spreadsheet.
- Track which team won the game/game time to help balance.
- Track who is AFK
- Use 3rd party Overwatch APIs to push teams to the game automatically. 
- Balance based on profile SR, would like to support handling smurfs, manually entering information, detecting unbalance based on wins/losses
- SR modifiers for drunk folks.
- Track wins/losses so players aren't just winning/losing all session.
